# Complementarities With I4R

.pull-left[
.font130[
- Contributions of I4R: 

   1. Increase the total number of reproductions with Replication Games (200!)
   2. Institutionalized an outlet to published constructive summaries for an important fraction of these exercises:  Discussion Paper Series (80!).

# Complementarities With I4R

.font130[
- SSRP can help as a starting point in the Reproduction-Replication continuum
- How can the SSRP can help Replication Game participants: 
  - As a companion and record to the reproduction section of the exercise. 
  
 </br></br></br></br></br>

- Aspiration: every RG participants/team enters a reproduction in the SSRP at the end of a RG day to standardize and preserve the non-replication part of its exercise.

# Pros and Cons of Using the SSRP for RGs Today

.font130[
- **Strengths**: Detailed guidance, and flexible platform to record as much detail as possible from a reproduction exercise.  

</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>

- **Weakness**: Too much detail can be overwhelming. Lots of space for improvement in user experience.

# Demo of RG-type Reproduction in the SSRP
.font120[
- We will start by looking at a high profile journal: AER-I 
- Starting from the latest look for a paper that has a reproduction package with data and code: [June 2023 Issue](https://www.aeaweb.org/issues/723) (September had none!)
- First found with data and code: [Leonardi & Moretti (2023)](https://eml.berkeley.edu/%7Emoretti/restaurants.pdf)
- Let's go to [socialsciencereproduction.org](www.socialsciencereproduction.org)
    0. Create an account/Log in. 
    1. Start a new reproduction.
    2. Look for the paper's DOI.
    3. Download [reproduction package](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/170981/version/V1/view?path=/openicpsr/170981/fcr:versions/V1&type=project), and check readme file to see if there is enough data to conduct a reproduction.
    4. [Optional] Set up a repository for your potential improvements.  
- Now we will see how to record this reproduction with some detail, and just the essential.

# Demo: Some Detail 1/2   

**Scope:**   
1. Read the paper and define the scope of exercise: Identify the claim(s) of interest, and the display items that present evidence supporting this claim(s). 
 - "We find that after 2005, the geographical concentration of restaurants increased sharply and at an accelerating rate."  
 - Figure 2 (show how to enter it in table)

**Assess:**    
1. Read the readme file. 
2. [Optional] Provide a description of the materials found in the materials 
3. try to run the code
   - Change directories 
   - In my environment, I have `set varabbrev off` so here I need to turn them on again. 
   - `ssc install outreg2`
   - After modification, the code runs, and produces same output. 
4. Report.

# Demo: Some Detail 2/2    
**[Optional] Improve:**
1. Record the improvements made above
   - Added line to make it robust to no abbreviations. 
   - Added line to install `outreg2`
   
2. Suggest specific improvements:
   - Separate the file `replication_submit.do` into smaller self contained scripts (start with line 91). 

**[Optional] Robustness Check:**
 - Lines 245-248 looks strange, lets see how the results change without them
 - Report results (and add more suggestions for improvements if you want)

---
# Demo: Just The Essentials
  
**Scope:**   
1. Skip (record blank)

**Assess:**    
1. try to run the code
   - Change directories 
   - In my environment, I have `set varabbrev off` so here I need to turn them on again. 
   - `ssc install outreg2`
   - After modification, the code runs, and produces same output. 
2. Report: 
    - Click on Assess display item, click "+Assess additional display item" 
    - Add caption and answer yes to next question (5.1.1.2)
    - Then finish the assessment (materials, computation, subjective assessment)

Submit reproduction.    
    
- **Upcoming Feature:** Minimal Reproduction Version (Mid November): The essential reproduction, without having to know how to navigate to get it.
